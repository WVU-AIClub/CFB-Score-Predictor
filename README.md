# CFB-Score-Predictor
Two weekends ago, we created an AI model to predict the score of college football games. We performed a lot of data cleaning to properly format and organize the data. We used a Random Forest model to predict scores based on the per-game offensive and defensive stats of the teams competing. We are excited to continue testing our model against the results of the coming college football games. If we were to do this project again attempting to improve upon our current project, we would use a more in-depth dataset to try to predict the scores based on more intricate, complex, weekly data.

Our results this past weekend were:
WVU - 36.8 predicted - 38 actual
OSU - 29.96 predicted - 14 actual
